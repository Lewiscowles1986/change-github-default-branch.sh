# change-github-default-branch.sh

Usage 

```
change-github-default-branch.sh "$GITHUB_TOKEN" PurpleBooth/homebrew-repo
```

Does not delete the old default branch, or change where pull requests are based from, incase something breaks.

Thanks [mfcrocker](https://github.com/mfcrocker) for ubuntu fixes.
